# LegalEyes - AI-Powered T&C Summarizer

LegalEyes is a browser extension that helps you quickly understand long and complex Terms & Conditions documents, whether on web pages or in PDF files displayed in your browser. It uses Google's Gemini AI to provide a concise summary and flags potentially concerning clauses based on common patterns that might affect your rights or privacy.

NOTE: LegalEyes provides AI-generated analysis and is NOT a substitute for legal advice. Always review terms carefully and consult a legal professional if you have significant concerns.

    *   Click the Pop Out button (the arrow symbol â‡—) in the header to view results in a new window.

## Limitations & Security Considerations

*   PDF Extraction Quality: While PDF scanning is supported, the accuracy of text extraction depends on the PDF structure. Complex layouts, columns, tables, or image-based PDFs (scans) may result in incomplete or poorly formatted text being sent for analysis. Encrypted or password-protected PDFs cannot be processed.
*   HTML Extraction Accuracy: Automatically finding the correct block of T&C text on diverse websites is challenging. The extension uses various methods, but may occasionally fail or extract the wrong content. Summarizing selected text is often more reliable for specific sections on HTML pages.
*   AI Analysis Quality: The summary and concerning clause identification are performed by an AI (Google Gemini). While powerful, AI can make mistakes, misinterpret nuances, or miss important details. This is not legal advice.
*   API Key Storage: Your Google AI Gemini API key is stored in your browser's local storage (`browser.storage.local`).
    *   Security Risk: Browser local storage is not designed for highly sensitive secrets. Other extensions or malware on your computer could potentially access it, although browser protections aim to mitigate this.
    *   Recommendation: Use an API key generated specifically for this extension. Monitor its usage via your Google AI Studio dashboard. Avoid using keys associated with paid quotas or sensitive projects if possible. Revoke the key if you suspect misuse.
*   API Costs: While Google AI Studio offers a free tier for Gemini, heavy usage could potentially exceed free limits and incur costs. Monitor your usage.
